## My Journey as a Developer
I started off as an IT student in 2022, but quickly lost interest due to the slow paced environment and lack of real challenge. I decided it was best to drop out and and divert my energy towards self teaching myself Computer Science and Web Development. I started with freeCodeCamp, and through it did help me get my foot in the door, I felt like it was still too slow for my liking. Which is when I came accross a course called "[CS50x - Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/)" taught by Professor David Malan. This is when things **really** started to kick into gear for me. I fast tracked through the course and, despite  how challenging it was, it was *exactly* what I was searching for. Before I knew it, I was already submitting my final project, [TuneScan](https://github.com/wakeupaj/FinalProject--TuneScan), while also working on a personal side project, that would end up being an app still used by my friends and I today. (*[MobRadio](https://github.com/wakeupaj/mob-radio)*)

Upon my completion of [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/), I quickly began [CS50p - Introduction to Programming with Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/), and likewise with [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/), I flew through the course and gained an exceptional understanding of Python. 

As of right now I am ~~working~~ *volunteering* as the **Lead Developer** of **[Luminar Finance üåô](https://github.com/wakeupaj/luminarfinance)**, a *Futures Trading Advisory Service* startup founded by a few close friends and I. At the time of writing this I am currently working on the [website](https://luminarfinance.net), using mega-popular JavaScript Web-Dev library; [React.js](https://github.com/topics/react). It's been a tough learning curve so far yet I am just now starting to get the hang of it. JavaScript is completely new to me, so it's definitely been a challenge but there are tons of resources and tools online to help a beginner like myself.
